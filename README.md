# Object-Detection-with-Bounding-Box

This repository contains code and resources for implementing object detection with bounding boxes. The goal of this project is to provide a flexible and efficient solution for detecting objects in images and annotating them with bounding boxes.

## Dataset 
My Games Pic dataset from roboflow is used in this project, can be downloaded from https://universe.roboflow.com/my-game-pics/my-game-pics

It contains 9724 images divided into train, valid and test folders.
